# Dear

Because it's nice to write letters.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'dear'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install dear

## About
Letters to your terminal/dear x is a set of gems that allow you to write
unnecessarily verbose commands to perform simple tasks. The following are planned
so far.

* [dear-git](https://github.com/letters-to-your-terminal/dear-git)
* [dear-rails](https://github.com/letters-to-your-terminal/dear-rails)
* [dear-ruby](https://github.com/letters-to-your-terminal/dear-ruby)

Hopefully after these three are finished, more will come. You can install each of
the gems seperately or install this meta gem that depends on all of them.

## Plans for the future 

* dear-bundler
* dear-gem
